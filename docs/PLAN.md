# Personal Portfolio Website Plan

This document outlines the plan for creating and deploying a personal portfolio website for `astaran.cloud`.

## 1. Project Overview

The goal is to build a modern, professional, and fast personal portfolio website. The website will be a single-page application, inspired by the provided screenshots, and will include the following sections:

*   **Home:** A hero section with a brief introduction.
*   **About:** A more detailed section about your background and skills.
*   **Blog:** A collection of your articles, which can be managed easily.
*   **Portfolio/Projects:** A showcase of your work.
*   **Experience:** Your professional experience timeline.
*   **Contact:** A simple way for people to get in touch with you.
*   **Resume:** A link to download your resume.

The website will be secure (HTTPS) and hosted on your domain `astaran.cloud`. The entire solution is designed to be highly cost-effective by leveraging serverless technologies and static site generation.

## 2. Proposed Technology Stack

To achieve a high-quality, performant, and easy-to-maintain website, I recommend the following technologies:

*   **Frontend Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React)**
    *   **Why:** Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables **Static Site Generation (SSG)**. This means we can pre-build the entire website into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Performance:** Static sites are incredibly fast because they are served directly from a CDN.
        *   **Cost-Effective:** Hosting static files is very cheap.
        *   **SEO:** Great for search engine optimization.
        *   **Scalability:** Handles traffic spikes with ease.

*   **Styling: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**
    *   **Why:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development. It's highly customizable and helps create a clean and modern design, similar to the inspiration website.

*   **Blog Content: [Markdown Files](https://www.markdownguide.org/)**
    *   **Why:** Storing blog posts as Markdown files within the project is the simplest and most cost-effective solution. You can write posts in any text editor and push them to your repository to publish.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **No Database Needed:** Reduces complexity and cost.
        *   **Version Control:** Your content is versioned with your code in Git.
        *   **Simplicity:** Easy to write and manage.

*   **Contact Form: [Serverless Function](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/what-is-serverless/)**
    *   **Why:** We can create a simple API using a serverless function (like AWS Lambda) that takes the form data and sends you an email using **Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)**.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Pay-per-use:** Extremely cost-effective for a low-traffic portfolio. You only pay when someone uses the form.
        *   **Secure:** No need to expose your email address on the frontend.

## 3. Proposed AWS Architecture for Hosting

For hosting, I propose a serverless architecture on AWS that is secure, scalable, and very low-cost.

*   **Storage: [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)**
    *   We will use an S3 bucket to store the static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images) generated by Next.js.

*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN): [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)**
    *   CloudFront will sit in front of our S3 bucket. It will cache the website content at edge locations around the world, ensuring fast delivery to your visitors.

*   **DNS: [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)**
    *   We will use Route 53 to manage your domain `astaran.cloud` and point it to the CloudFront distribution.

*   **Security (HTTPS): [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)**
    *   ACM provides **free** SSL/TLS certificates that can be easily integrated with CloudFront to serve your website over a secure HTTPS connection.

### How It Works:

1.  A visitor goes to `https://astaran.cloud`.
2.  Route 53 directs the request to the CloudFront distribution.
3.  CloudFront serves the cached static website content from the nearest edge location. If not cached, it fetches it from the S3 bucket.
4.  The visitor's browser receives the website content quickly and securely.

## 4. Deployment Strategy (CI/CD)

To automate the deployment process, we will set up a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline.

*   **Source Control: [GitHub](https://github.com/)**
    *   Your website's code will be stored in a GitHub repository.

*   **CI/CD Pipeline: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)**
    *   We will create a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically triggers when you push changes to your main branch.
    *   **The workflow will:**
        1.  **Build the Site:** Run the Next.js build process to generate the static files.
        2.  **Deploy to S3:** Sync the newly built static files to your S3 bucket.
        3.  **Invalidate Cache:** Invalidate the CloudFront cache to ensure visitors see the latest version of your site.

## 5. High-Level Project Steps

Here is the sequence of steps we will follow to bring your portfolio to life:

1.  **Phase 1: Project Setup & Initial Build (Local)**
    *   Initialize a new Next.js project with Tailwind CSS.
    *   Create the basic structure and components for each section (Home, About, etc.).
    *   Develop the UI based on the provided inspiration.
    *   Set up the blog system using local Markdown files.

2.  **Phase 2: AWS Infrastructure Setup**
    *   Set up an S3 bucket for static website hosting.
    *   Create a CloudFront distribution pointing to the S3 bucket.
    *   Provision a free SSL certificate in ACM and attach it to CloudFront.
    *   Configure Route 53 to point `astaran.cloud` to the CloudFront distribution.

3.  **Phase 3: Deployment and CI/CD**
    *   Create the GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployments.
    *   Perform the first deployment to AWS.
    *   Test the live website.

4.  **Phase 4: Contact Form**
    *   Set up Amazon SES to send emails.
    *   Create an AWS Lambda function and an API Gateway endpoint to handle the contact form submissions.
    *   Integrate the API with the contact form on the frontend.

## 6. Cost Estimation: Serverless vs. Lightsail vs. Amplify

Here is a high-level cost comparison for hosting the portfolio website, assuming low to moderate traffic typical for a personal site.

| Service | Monthly Cost (Estimate) | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Serverless (S3 + CloudFront)** | **~$0.50 - $2.00** | - Extremely low cost (mostly for the domain).<br>- Highly scalable and performant.<br>- Minimal maintenance ("set it and forget it").<br>- Leverages AWS Free Tier effectively. | - Initial setup is more involved (multiple services). |
| **2. AWS Lightsail** | **~$4.00 - $5.00** | - Fixed, predictable monthly price.<br>- Simple to get started with a pre-configured stack. | - You manage the server (updates, security).<br>- More expensive for a simple static site.<br>- Less scalable than the serverless option. |
| **3. AWS Amplify** | **~$1.00 - $5.00+** | - Very fast to deploy from a Git repository.<br>- CI/CD is built-in and easy to set up.<br>- Manages all infrastructure for you. | - Can become more expensive as traffic and build times increase.<br>- Less granular control over the underlying infrastructure. |

### Cost Breakdown:

*   **Serverless (Recommended):**
    *   **AWS Free Tier:** For the first 12 months, S3 storage, CloudFront data transfer, and Lambda requests will likely be fully covered.
    *   **Main Cost:** The only consistent cost will be **$0.50/month for the Route 53 hosted zone**. After the free tier, costs will remain very low, likely under $2/month unless the site gets a huge amount of traffic.

*   **AWS Lightsail:**
    *   The cheapest instance is **$3.50/month**. This gives you a full virtual server, which is more than you need for a static site and requires you to handle server maintenance. You would also add the **$0.50/month** for Route 53.

*   **AWS Amplify:**
    *   Amplify has a generous free tier (1,000 build minutes, 5 GB storage, 15 GB data served per month). For a small portfolio, you might stay within the free tier for a while.
    *   However, costs can be less predictable than the pure serverless S3/CloudFront approach if you exceed the free tier limits.

### Recommendation:

The **Serverless architecture (S3 + CloudFront)** remains the most cost-effective and professionally robust solution for this use case. It provides the best performance and scalability for the lowest long-term cost, with almost no maintenance required after the initial setup.

While AWS Amplify is a great alternative for its ease of use, the S3/CloudFront approach gives you more control and is a fantastic learning experience for modern cloud infrastructure.
